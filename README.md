# Library Book Manager (Python Mini Project)

This is my mini project for the Python course (Unit-2).  
The project is a simple Library Book Manager made using core Python concepts.  
It runs in the terminal and allows adding books, viewing, searching, borrowing,  
and returning books. I also added CSV file handling so the data is saved even  
after closing the program.

The borrowed list is stored in a CSV file.

### 5. Return Book

It also shows a list comprehension output of all borrowed books.

This makes the project work even after restarting.
